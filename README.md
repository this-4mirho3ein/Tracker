# Tracker

This is the first project of the #100daysofcode challenge that I have code the frontend of an exchange .

My goal is to simply code this whole site as much simple as possible (by just pure HTML , CSS ) and then start improving it once it's done ( starting to use Freameworks like Tailwind and React ).

In the First day of the challenge I tried to code the header and the footer of this project in a simple way with just using HTML and CSS
